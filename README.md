# Used multiple API calls from different data sources to generate a combination of weather and solar data in the effort of to compare solar efficiency by latitude vs weather conditions by latitude.
# Used generated solar data to run multiple scatter plots as well as linear regression to understand the impact of time of year vs solar efficiency

#Continued using the solar data to generate heat maps showing different components of solar efficiency at different times of the year.
